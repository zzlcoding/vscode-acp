# ACP Client for VS Code

A [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.acp-client) that provides a client for the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) — connect to any ACP-compatible AI coding agent directly from your editor.

## Features

- **Single-Agent Focus**: One agent active at a time — seamlessly switch between agents
- **Per-Agent Session List**: Each agent in the Agents view is expandable into its previous sessions. Click a session to restore its history in the chat. Backed by `session/list` when the agent supports it, or by a local per-workspace cache otherwise.
- **Session Config Options**: Dynamic per-session selectors (mode, model, reasoning level, …) advertised by the agent are rendered automatically in the composer toolbar.
- **Interactive Chat**: Built-in chat panel with Markdown rendering, inline tool call display, and collapsible tool sections
- **Thinking Display**: See agent reasoning in a collapsible block with streaming animation and elapsed time
- **Slash Commands**: Autocomplete popup for agent-provided commands with keyboard navigation
- **Mode & Model Picker**: Switch agent modes and models directly from the chat toolbar (kept for agents that haven't migrated to Session Config Options yet)
- **Tab Mode Cycling**: Press `Tab` in the input box to quickly cycle through available agent modes
- **File System Integration**: Agents can read and write files in your workspace
- **Terminal Execution**: Agents can run commands with terminal output display
- **Permission Management**: Configurable auto-approve policies for agent actions
- **Protocol Traffic Logging**: Inspect all ACP JSON-RPC messages with request/response/notification labels
- **Chat Persistence**: Conversations are preserved when switching panels

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- VS Code 1.85+

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-acp.git
cd vscode-acp
npm install
```

### Build & Run

```bash
npm run compile    # One-time build
npm run watch      # Watch mode for development
```

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

### Testing

```bash
npm run pretest    # Compile tests + lint
npm test           # Run tests
```

### Packaging

```bash
npm run package    # Production build
npx @vscode/vsce package   # Create .vsix
```

## Architecture

The extension follows a modular architecture:

- **Core**: `AgentManager`, `ConnectionManager`, `SessionManager`, `AcpClientImpl`
- **Handlers**: `FileSystemHandler`, `TerminalHandler`, `PermissionHandler`, `SessionUpdateHandler`
- **UI**: `SessionTreeProvider`, `ChatWebviewProvider`, `StatusBarManager`
- **Config**: `AgentConfig`, `RegistryClient`
- **Utils**: `Logger`, `StreamAdapter`

Communication with agents uses the ACP protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio).

## Known Issues

- Agents must be available via the system PATH or `npx`
- Some agents may require additional authentication setup
- File attachment feature is not yet functional
